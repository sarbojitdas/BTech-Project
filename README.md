### EAR ENHANCEMENT DEVICE
#####We have always imagined how it would feel if we could have heightened 
senses. Would it be beneficial for the current human condition or would it be too 
much for the brain to process those signals which are beyond our range of hearing 
or seeing or feeling. With this imagination of feeling what is beyond our grip of 
understanding we started planning for a human sense enhancement device. Just 
like the night vision goggles allows us to see in the dark as if it was daytime, our 
Ear enhancement system focuses on a similar goal but on a different sense of the 
human being which is hearing. This device would allow us not only to hear very 
low amplitude sounds that we canâ€™t normally hear but also detect Ultrasonic Sound 
that will expand our range of hearing. Hence, to achieve this result we have chosen 
two separate circuits, each having their own functions and uses, one was the 
Amplifier Stage which is basically an Audio Detector and Amplifier and the 
second is the Ultrasonic Proximity Detector, which is used by many blind people 
to detect sounds in a wider range of hearing and react to situations faster. Our main 
objective is to design these two circuits individually and then couple them together 
to form the entire circuit.
